 * The "neighbors" field is a three-element array whose elements
 * point to adjacent nodes in the tree.
 * For a leaf node, there is just one adjacent node, which is

 * For an internal node, there are exactly three adjacent nodes,

 * Since the final tree is unrooted, there is ultimately no particular
 * distinction ("parent" or "child") among the three neighbors of

 * should store the "parent pointer" of a node in neighbors[0]
 * and the "child pointers" in neighbors[1] and neighbors[2].

 * be stored in the neighbors[0] field of both of the nodes that
